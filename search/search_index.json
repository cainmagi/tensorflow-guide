是一个开放源代码软件库，用于进行高性能数值计算。借助其灵活的架构，用户可以轻松地将计算工作部署到多种平台（CPU、GPU、TPU）和设备（桌面设备、服务器集群、移动设备、边缘设备等）。TensorFlow™ 最初是由 Google Brain 团队（隶属于 Google 的 AI 部门）中的研究人员和工程师开发的，可为机器学习和深度学习提供强力支持，并且其灵活的数值计算核心广泛应用于许多其他科学领域。 Tensorflow治学 ¶ 写在所有内容之前，读者不得不看以下几个页面，本教程所述内容大略来自于对这些资料的研读。 Tensorflow官网(中/英文) : https://www.tensorflow.org/ Keras中文文档 : https://keras.io/zh/ Tensorflow 2.0前瞻(英文) : https://medium.com/tensorflow/effective-tensorflow-2-0-best-practices-and-whats-changed-a0ca48767aff Tensorflow 2.0前瞻(中文) : https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/50049041 提示 特别值得注意的是，现在官方文档至少在教程部分， 已经支持中英双语 。相比官方文档，我们的教程更侧重于以搭建工程为导向的设计。然而现在官方文档的翔实可读程度，确实不可错过 大略来说，学习Tensorflow主要应当依赖于官方文档的介绍。敝人自r1.4版开始入门Tensorflow，即是通过学习官方文档的教程来快速上手。相比四处蒐集资料，官方文档能提供一个完整、系统、完全贴合时下最新API的例子，帮助用户建立一个与Tensorflow各个功能合宜的使用习惯。若是通过在Github上检索他人的Project，固然是一个很好的上手办法，但是往往就会遗漏某些重要的功能而不学。例如，Tensorflow自带的网络存取和Tensorboard API，在时兴的一些Project中，经常会因方便之故，以numpy的IO来代替。笔者以为，如此培养起来的使用习惯，可谓走入偏门。当然，从这一点来说，本教程也亦复如是，即使笔者写下这些内容的时候，参照的乃是时下最新的API，时间一久，难免会过时。倘若笔者懒惰一些，不再时时更新本教程，那么本教程也就入不足取之流了。 虽然如此，教程也有并不合宜的地方。最大的问题莫过于Tensorflow本身，它有着日新月异的变化，此时能圆转如意地使用的API，到了彼时也许就成了废案。这就导致Tensorflow的官方教程也不断更新。r1.4时，教程还主要集中在如何使用“底层”API上，到了r1.9.0，就已经变成基本围绕着 tf.keras 设计的思路了。最新消息显示，即将上线的Tensorflow 2.0，将会彻底抛弃过去的“中层”API以下的全部方法， tf.layers , tf.contrib 都将被移除，倘若长期墨守成规，局限在入门时候的一套技术上，迟早会被官方库如此迅速的更新所弃。这也是无可奈何之事。毕竟Tensorflow仍然处于不断改进之中。倘若希望追求一个更加稳定、长期可用的库，keras或许是一个不错的选择。 故而，本教程将基本基于Tensorflow现在的版本(r1.13)展开介绍。本教程既可以看作一个入门教程，也可以看作是本人重新自学新版Tensorflow规范化API的一个手记，故而命名本教程为“手札”。读者不妨跟着笔者的思路，有如与笔者共学一般读下来本教程。 Tensorflow原理 ¶ 一个标准的Tensorflow工作流可以表示成这样： graph TD st(开始) --> Sess[启动Session] Sess --> ConNet[构建网络] subgraph 构造流程 ioNet>读取网络参数] --> ConNet end subgraph 执行流程 ioDat>导入数据] --> Run ConNet --> Run[执行网络] Run --> ioNetS>保存网络参数] Run --> ioRes>导出结果] end ioRes --> SessCl[关闭Session] SessCl --> ed(结束) classDef styStart fill:#FAE6A9,stroke:#BA9132; classDef styIO fill:#cde498,stroke:#13540c; class st,ed styStart class ioNet,ioNetS,ioDat,ioRes styIO 与一般的计算库不同，Tensorflow的执行流程大体可以分为两步： 构造流程 : 在这一步，Tensorflow根据用户代码构造一个 数据流图(dataflow graph) 。所谓数据流图，指的是由一系列 张量(Tensor) 构成的符号运算集合。就如同一张流程图一样，在这一阶段，尽管用户定义了每一步的运算（从简单的加减乘除到复杂的网络单元），但是没有任何运算被执行。就像一个程序员撰写代码一样，Tensorflow在这一步，将用户的代码转换成它的“机器语言”，但是网络还没有进入被使用的阶段。 执行流程 : 在这一步，Tensorflow将计算用户指定的某个 Tensor 的输出结果。要得到一个Tensor的输出，则必须得计算它一系列的依赖变量。例如，我们已知 y = x_1 + x_2 y = x_1 + x_2 , x_2 = z_1 \\times z_2 x_2 = z_1 \\times z_2 。那么，如果Tensorflow要得到 y y 的结果，它就必须先计算 x_2 x_2 。这个过程被完全地封装起来，从用户看来，我们只需要调用 y y 的输出即可，不需要关心Tensorflow是怎样按照流图完成计算的。 因此，典型的Tensorflow式的语言风格也可以这样划分： 构造流程 : 用户定义整个网络的符号运算，指定网络各个节点的属性、输入和输出。这些代码往往被写成一个函数（例如 def construct (): ） 执行流程 : 创建一个Session，在Session内调用构造函数，然后输入数据，得到并保存输出结果。必要情况下，还需要导入导出网络参数。 这里提到 会话(Session) 。Session如同一个Tensorflow虚拟机，在一个Session打开的时候，设备的计算资源（GPU, CPU, 带宽等）才被加载。Session又如同一个工人，用户撰写的网络构造代码如同车间，输入的数据如同商品，“工人（Session）”利用预定义好的“车间（流图）”将可以快速、批量地生产这些“商品（数据）”。这样地设计保证了一些外围的代码，例如指定网络参数的名称、函数的属性等操作，不需要重复进行，从而确保处理数据的时候，总是执行必要的代码，加快运算速度。 另一方面，构造-执行的结构还封装了许多提高运算效率的特性，例如多线程。尽管用户定义网络构造的时候，所写的代码是按照逻辑顺序的、线性的。但实际运行的时候，Tensorflow可以自行发现网络的哪些部分可以被同时运行，从而利用多核系统的计算资源。这些过程也是被完全封装起来的，用户并不需要花费心思去专门进行这些调整。 Tensorflow API架构 ¶ 下图显示了当前Tensorflow-API的组织形式 Tensorflow在多个平台上均有部署，包括Python, C++, Java, Javascript, Go等，未来还可能支持更多的语言。然而，不同平台上，API的使用方式和代码风格是大不相同的。例如，Python的语言风格目前已经朝向Keras转变，而Javascript仍倾向于使用中层API；C++和Java偏向于使用底层API编写程序。本教程只针对时兴Python的API编写，除非涉及到特定的专题，不会讨论其他语言上Tensorflow的用法。 一般而言，Tensorflow将API面向划分为三个层次： 高层API (High level) : 包括Estimators和Keras； 中层API (Mid level) : 包括layers, datasets, loss和metrics等具有功能性的函数，例如网络层的定义，Loss Function，对结果的测量函数等； 底层API (Low level) : 包括具体的加减乘除、具有解析式的数学函数、卷积、对Tensor属性的测量等。 从r1.4入门的用户，所接受的训练往往是从底层API开始，使用自己的代码风格构建对应中层API的函数，然后再用自己定义好的中层API构建网络。在这种代码风格的驱使下，用户除了需要定义各个网络层具体的表达式，还需要设计输入输出的接口，用来调用 优化器(optimizer) 的接口等操作。 另一种使用方式，是从中层API开始，直接使用预定义好的网络层构建网络，这样的代码风格会节省一部分时间，相当于几乎不再需要接触底层API，但是在输入输出、网络训练和测试等更高层的模块设计上，和底层API用户的代码风格相似。 Estimators是从r1.4就已经存在的API了，它可以被看成是已经集成在Tensorflow里的完整的网络。因此，Estimators往往适合分发、需求不高的应用，但是并不适合使用Tensorflow的研究者。尽管至今为止，Tensorflow仍然对Estimators倍加推崇，但本教程将完全不涉及这方面的内容。 另一个高层API是 Eager Execution ，从r1.9起，Tensorflow就加入了这种新的使用模式，并且在Tensorflow 2.0中，它仍然将会被保留。Eager摈弃了上述的构造-执行流程，任何对Tensor的定义会被立时计算、并可得到结果。对于需要进行小规模的调试、检查API功能的用户而言更加方便。但是，据一些用户的反响，现在Eager还没有做到和之前API的完全兼容，本教程将基本不涉及Eager的用法。 因此，Keras API将是本教程的重中之重。使用本教程的用户，可以对照目前的官方文档，跟进本教程的思路，自己逐步实现各个Project的设计。使用Keras风格的设计，代码量会明显少于前面提到的各种风格（Estimators除外）。事实上， tf.keras 和底层API之间具有一定的兼容，这样的编写风格能让我们在满足自己设计的派生功能的基础上，尽可能使用规范化、预定义的API单元，从而减少代码出错的可能性。通过对本教程TF 1.x版的学习，对未来2.0版的上手也会带来莫大帮助。 金宇琛( @cainmagi )，2019年3月2日 Yuchen Jin( @cainmagi ), Mar. 2, 2019 教程导读 ¶ 接下来，本教程将会涉及 从线性规划入门 : 如何使用Tensorflow完成一个简单的线性规划设计，我们将从Hello World开始，逐步过渡到一个具有核函数的非线性规划Project。 Hello world: 第一个Tensorflow程序。 线性规划: 一个简单的二分类问题。 线性回归: 一个同样简单的，线性拟合问题。 非线性回归: 拟合一个简单的，可以表达出解析式的非线性函数。 非线性规划: 使用线性分类器对非线性分布的数据进行分类。 训练与测试分立 : 从这一章开始，并试图解决几个更加复杂的实际问题。这里涉及到的Project相对更大、更完整，训练往往需要一定时间才能完成。因此，在本章，所有项目的训练、测试环节都会分开，我们将从这里开始，使用TensorBoard跟踪我们的训练情况，并介绍如何存取神经网络。 Super Resolution: 使用神经网络进行图像像素插值。 Sparse Coding: 使用线性的词典学习(dictionary learning)来进行图像像素插值。 Generitive Model: 使用时兴的生成模型(Generitive Model)来完成图像风格的转换。 原生的数据管理 : 从这一章开始，我们将纳入Tensorflow自带的数据管理API。实际上，很多用户并不习惯使用这些API，往往倾向于自己完成数据的导入导出。虽然这并非一个复杂的工作，但据Tensorflow的文档，原生的数据管理内部实现了多线程，本身更适合用于提高数据IO的效率。读者可以酌情选择是否需要阅读本章。 使用MINIST数据集: 使用原生的数据管理来IO一个现成的MINIST数据集，这一节改自 官方文档教程 。 使用RNN处理文章: 通过LSTM模型来进行文本分类，并使用原生的数据管理来IO一个现成的IMDB数据集，这一节改自 官方文档教程 。 使用RBM生成音频: 通过限制玻尔兹曼机(RBM)来编写一个简单的音乐生成器，这一节改自 llSourcell/Music_Generator_Demo 。 其他的高级技巧 : 本章将介绍一些特殊的、利用底层API技巧，使得用户能更灵活地定制Tensorflow-keras，从而实现一些仅依靠原生库不能实现的功能。","text_tokens":["所谓","例如","best","搜索","定义","加快","目前","入门教程","javascript","加减","需求","imdb","多种","灵活","桌面","尽可","务器","可能","减少","搜","全部","新版","新","按照","专题","教程","地方","进入","tensorflow","进行","系统","明显","实际上","_","会","典型","ionets","除外","更新","有着","加载","时间","cde498","入","带宽","模块","重中之重","奈何","事实","借助","若","编写程序","程序员","派生","内部","双语","之中","部分","文章","阶段","小规模","规模","即将","一方","为","多","zhihu","划分","工程师","多核","广泛","以下","而","结构","不合宜","涉及","性能","无法","复杂","搭建","eager","网络单元","研究者","工作","指","偏门","“","彻底","服务","classdef","操作","9.0","（","平台","特别","必要","这样","问题","一点","中层","器","至今","义好","第一","难免","这方面","代替","跟进","摈弃","流图","看成","出","如同","长期","graph","为止","@","我们","手札","出错","构造函数","得到","解析","tf","机器语言","从而","线性规划","sess","阅读","工人","使用","中","追求","各个","规划","扉页",",","则","许多","当前","显示","自带","二","分开","初学者","原理","表示","无可奈何","13540c","既","function","自","更加","简单","除了","被","他人","不会","加减乘除","让","非线性","分类器","认识","）","没有","驱使","机器","变化",";","此时","一方面","重于","然而","计算","其","墨守","参数","st","同样","读","才能","线性","是从","测量","多个","起来","讨论","消息","迟早","结果","看作","会话","关心","存取","所述","p","莫过","之故","上述","集中","式","利用","完善","参照","generitive","金宇琛","特定","难免会","基于","

另一方面，构造-执行的结构还封装了许多提高运算效率的特性，例如多线程。尽管用户定义网络构造的时候，所写的代码是按照逻辑顺序的、线性的。但实际运行的时候，Tensorflow可以自行发现网络的哪些部分可以被同时运行，从而利用多核系统的计算资源。这些过程也是被完全封装起来的，用户并不需要花费心思去专门进行这些调整。","text_tokens":["所谓","了","重复","例如","生产","代码","图","定义","加快","导入","下","逻辑","执行","加减","才","\\","符号","。","construct","任何","写成","一些","按照","完成","每","花费","商品","一系","进入","tensorflow","多线程","分为","往往","进行","系统","用户","乘除","_","构造","流程","已知","然后","哪些","流","还","ionets","典型",":","语言","过程","run","加载","cde498","”",")","带宽","属性","iores","撰写","效率","等","程序员","调用","根据","集合","可以","ed","风格","是","那么","创建","名称","部分","阶段","一方","它","启动","得","划分","多核","td","设计","的","先","这","stroke","虚拟","结构","到","、","复杂","读取","dataflow","速度","times","网络单元","stystart","如果","工作","依赖","快速","所写","构成","def","一系列","开始","指","怎样","connet","“","class","subgraph","函数","classdef","某个","gpu","另一方","操作","（","必要","提到","输入","这样","iodat","一张","sesscl","义好","但是","自行","车间","尽管","虚拟机","整个","cpu","一步","流图","方面","封装","大体","和","一般","如同","转换成","graph","需要","数据流","我们","标准","换成","处理","构造函数","单元","得到","构建","机器语言","情况","x","sess","从而","数据","这些","工人","网络","使用","计算资源","各个","资源","fae6a9","输出",",","则","许多","关闭","内","结束","批量","调整","表示","13540c","特性","就","fill","保证","另一方面","要","简单","从","被","预定","两步","这个","外围","看来","加减乘除","运算","确保","但","发现","）","没有","并不需要","张量","]","多线","机器","session",";","库","一样","ba9132","也","地","流程图","一方面","计算","参数","st","转换","线性","起来","节点","结果","z","会话","成","打开","关心","总是","-","ionet","end","[","式","2","利用","导出","，","专门","将","实际","并","一个","时候","运行","一","变量","

Tensorflow在多个平台上均有部署，包括Python, C++, Java, Javascript, Go等，未来还可能支持更多的语言。然而，不同平台上，API的使用方式和代码风格是大不相同的。例如，Python的语言风格目前已经朝向Keras转变，而Javascript仍倾向于使用中层API；C++和Java偏向于使用底层API编写程序。本教程只针对时兴Python的API编写，除非涉及到特定的专题，不会讨论其他语言上Tensorflow的用法。 一般而言，Tensorflow将API面向划分为三个层次： 高层API (High level) : 包括Estimators和Keras； 中层API (Mid level) : 包括layers, datasets, loss和metrics等具有功能性的函数，例如网络层的定义，Loss Function，对结果的测量函数等； 底层API (Low level) : 包括具体的加减乘除、具有解析式的数学函数、卷积、对Tensor属性的测量等。 从r1.4入门的用户，所接受的训练往往是从底层API开始，使用自己的代码风格构建对应中层API的函数，然后再用自己定义好的中层API构建网络。在这种代码风格的驱使下，用户除了需要定义各个网络层具体的表达式，还需要设计输入输出的接口，用来调用 优化器(optimizer) 的接口等操作。 另一种使用方式，是从中层API开始，直接使用预定义好的网络层构建网络，这样的代码风格会节省一部分时间，相当于几乎不再需要接触底层API，但是在输入输出、网络训练和测试等更高层的模块设计上，和底层API用户的代码风格相似。 Estimators是从r1.4就已经存在的API了，它可以被看成是已经集成在Tensorflow里的完整的网络。因此，Estimators往往适合分发、需求不高的应用，但是并不适合使用Tensorflow的研究者。尽管至今为止，Tensorflow仍然对Estimators倍加推崇，但本教程将完全不涉及这方面的内容。 另一个高层API是 Eager Execution ，从r1.9起，Tensorflow就加入了这种新的使用模式，并且在Tensorflow 2.0中，它仍然将会被保留。Eager摈弃了上述的构造-执行流程，任何对Tensor的定义会被立时计算、并可得到结果。对于需要进行小规模的调试、检查API功能的用户而言更加方便。但是，据一些用户的反响，现在Eager还没有做到和之前API的完全兼容，本教程将基本不涉及Eager的用法。 因此，Keras API将是本教程的重中之重。使用本教程的用户，可以对照目前的官方文档，跟进本教程的思路，自己逐步实现各个Project的设计。使用Keras风格的设计，代码量会明显少于前面提到的各种风格（Estimators除外）。事实上， tf.keras 和底层API之间具有一定的兼容，这样的编写风格能让我们在满足自己设计的派生功能的基础上，尽可能使用规范化、预定义的API单元，从而减少代码出错的可能性。通过对本教程TF 1.x版的学习，对未来2.0版的上手也会带来莫大帮助。 金宇琛( @cainmagi )，2019年3月2日 Yuchen Jin( @cainmagi ), Mar. 2,

第一个Tensorflow程序。 线性规划: 一个简单的二分类问题。 线性回归: 一个同样简单的，线性拟合问题。 非线性回归: 拟合一个简单的，可以表达出解析式的非线性函数。 非线性规划: 使用线性分类器对非线性分布的数据进行分类。 训练与测试分立 : 从这一章开始，并试图解决几个更加复杂的实际问题。这里涉及到的Project相对更大、更完整，训练往往需要一定时间才能完成。因此，在本章，所有项目的训练、测试环节都会分开，我们将从这里开始，使用TensorBoard跟踪我们的训练情况，并介绍如何存取神经网络。 Super Resolution: 使用神经网络进行图像像素插值。 Sparse Coding: 使用线性的词典学习(dictionary learning)来进行图像像素插值。 Generitive Model: 使用时兴的生成模型(Generitive Model)来完成图像风格的转换。 原生的数据管理 : 从这一章开始，我们将纳入Tensorflow自带的数据管理API。实际上，很多用户并不习惯使用这些API，往往倾向于自己完成数据的导入导出。虽然这并非一个复杂的工作，但据Tensorflow的文档，原生的数据管理内部实现了多线程，本身更适合用于提高数据IO的效率。读者可以酌情选择是否需要阅读本章。 使用MINIST数据集: 使用原生的数据管理来IO一个现成的MINIST数据集，这一节改自 官方文档教程 。 使用RNN处理文章: 通过LSTM模型来进行文本分类，并使用原生的数据管理来IO一个现成的IMDB数据集，这一节改自 官方文档教程 。 使用RBM生成音频: 通过限制玻尔兹曼机(RBM)来编写一个简单的音乐生成器，这一节改自 llSourcell/Music_Generator_Demo 。 其他的高级技巧 : 本章将介绍一些特殊的、利用底层API技巧，使得用户能更灵活地定制Tensorflow-keras，从而实现一些仅依靠原生库不能实现的功能。","text_tokens":["如何","了","仅","是否","model","导入","imdb","功能","minist","灵活","。","词典","一些","项目","完成","教程","原生","多线程","io","tensorflow","api","进行","往往","但据","用户","learning","实际上","倾向","几个","_","会","不能","底层",":","一章","编写","demo","时间",")","coding","逐步","分立","效率","生成","学习","用于","风格","内部","可以","文章","对","更","一定","相对","测试","设计","的","sparse","这","涉及","到","、","resolution","复杂","管理","工作","实现","酌情","tensorboard","文档","开始","world","llsourcell","rbm","函数","官方","技巧","模型","试图","定制","通过","问题","音乐","第一","super","改","兹曼","接下来","限制","神经","下来","神经网络","出","需要","环节","我们","rnn","处理","解析","情况","神经网","从而","线性规划","图像","数据","阅读","并非","这些","高级","使用","入门","网络","hello","更大","现成","规划","纳入","分类","玻尔","/","二","自带","拟合","分开","介绍","文本","都","集","接下","训练","简单","project","更加","从","自","本章","keras","非线性","分类器","特殊","lstm","机","多线","将会","成器","库","虽然","地","同样","generator","才能","转换","玻尔兹曼","线性","生成器","第一个","习惯","分布","自己","于","music","存取","-","式","利用","导出","，","时兴","音频","将","实际","并","本","generitive","一个","使得","
