是一个开放源代码软件库，用于进行高性能数值计算。借助其灵活的架构，用户可以轻松地将计算工作部署到多种平台（CPU、GPU、TPU）和设备（桌面设备、服务器集群、移动设备、边缘设备等）。TensorFlow™ 最初是由 Google Brain 团队（隶属于 Google 的 AI 部门）中的研究人员和工程师开发的，可为机器学习和深度学习提供强力支持，并且其灵活的数值计算核心广泛应用于许多其他科学领域。 Tensorflow治学 ¶ 写在所有内容之前，读者不得不看以下几个页面，本教程所述内容大略来自于对这些资料的研读。 Tensorflow官网(中/英文) : https://www.tensorflow.org/ Keras中文文档 : https://keras.io/zh/ Tensorflow 2.0前瞻(英文) : https://medium.com/tensorflow/effective-tensorflow-2-0-best-practices-and-whats-changed-a0ca48767aff Tensorflow 2.0前瞻(中文) : https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/50049041 提示 特别值得注意的是，现在官方文档至少在教程部分， 已经支持中英双语 。相比官方文档，我们的教程更侧重于以搭建工程为导向的设计。然而现在官方文档的翔实可读程度，确实不可错过 大略来说，学习Tensorflow主要应当依赖于官方文档的介绍。敝人自r1.4版开始入门Tensorflow，即是通过学习官方文档的教程来快速上手。相比四处蒐集资料，官方文档能提供一个完整、系统、完全贴合时下最新API的例子，帮助用户建立一个与Tensorflow各个功能合宜的使用习惯。若是通过在Github上检索他人的Project，固然是一个很好的上手办法，但是往往就会遗漏某些重要的功能而不学。例如，Tensorflow自带的网络存取和Tensorboard API，在时兴的一些Project中，经常会因方便之故，以numpy的IO来代替。笔者以为，如此培养起来的使用习惯，可谓走入偏门。当然，从这一点来说，本教程也亦复如是，即使笔者写下这些内容的时候，参照的乃是时下最新的API，时间一久，难免会过时。倘若笔者懒惰一些，不再时时更新本教程，那么本教程也就入不足取之流了。 虽然如此，教程也有并不合宜的地方。最大的问题莫过于Tensorflow本身，它有着日新月异的变化，此时能圆转如意地使用的API，到了彼时也许就成了废案。这就导致Tensorflow的官方教程也不断更新。r1.4时，教程还主要集中在如何使用“底层”API上，到了r1.9.0，就已经变成基本围绕着 tf.keras 设计的思路了。最新消息显示，即将上线的Tensorflow 2.0，将会彻底抛弃过去的“中层”API以下的全部方法， tf.layers , tf.contrib 都将被移除，倘若长期墨守成规，局限在入门时候的一套技术上，迟早会被官方库如此迅速的更新所弃。这也是无可奈何之事。毕竟Tensorflow仍然处于不断改进之中。倘若希望追求一个更加稳定、长期可用的库，keras或许是一个不错的选择。 故而，本教程将基本基于Tensorflow现在的版本(r1.12)展开介绍。本教程既可以看作一个入门教程，也可以看作是本人重新自学新版Tensorflow规范化API的一个手记，故而命名本教程为“手札”。读者不妨跟着笔者的思路，有如与笔者共学一般读下来本教程。 Tensorflow原理 ¶ Tensorflow API架构 ¶ 教程导读
